## Summary

For Sum Issue, 
* generally two approaches: 
    one is two pointers skill
    the other is using Map
* for two pointers skill, it only works when the array is sorted so that you know which direction the pointer will move to. 
* for map skill, the array can be not ordered, you can check if (target-current) exists or not in the map.
